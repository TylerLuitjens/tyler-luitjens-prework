      <p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! Feel free to take a look around, and if you have any questions or comments, please visit the "Contact" page with any feedback. <br><br>
        My name is Tyler, and I am 23 years old. For the past couple years I have worked at a small SaaS company called MenuSys that makes software for car dealerships.
        They are based out of Eau Claire, WI, which is where I graduated from college. <br><br> 
        Outside of my time at work, I very much enjoy camping, hammocking, and fishing (when the weather here permits, of course).  I also have a passion for cooking, and (of course) coding! <br><br>
        Like many others, a lot of the things on my bucketlist have to do with traveling. The biggest thing for me is that I want to visit every National Park in the United States, plus Banff National
        Park in Canada. To get started on this, my wife and I are planning on going to Glacier National Park in Montana for our honeymoon.
