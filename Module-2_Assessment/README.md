Thank you for downloading my Hangman game!

To get started, simply open index.html in your browser, and follow the prompts on screen. 

All of the words have to do with space in some way, shape, or form. Try to guess the word without running out of fuel! If you win, you will hear a congratulatory song play, but if you run out of fuel before you can figure out the word, you will hear your ship powering down. 

If you have any issues or comments about the game, feel free to reach out to me at tyluitjens@gmail.com.
